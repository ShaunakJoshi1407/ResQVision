# ResQVision

For making changes in this branch, I would recommend using a node version like 18, which is more stable. 

Clone this repository and then switch to this branch.

Run `cd resqvision`.

Then run `npm install` or  `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies.

To start the server, run `npm run dev` or `npm start` or `pnpm run dev`. The server will start running on `http://localhost:5173/`.

Either make changes to this branch or to a new branch checked out from this one.
